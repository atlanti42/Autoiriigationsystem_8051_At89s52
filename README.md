# Autoiriigationsystem_8051_At89s52
This project on "Automatic Irrigation System on Sensing Soil Moisture Content" is intended to create an automated irrigation mechanism which turns the pumping motor ON and OFF on detecting the moisture content of the earth. In the domain of farming, utilization of appropriate means of irrigation is significant. The benefit of employing these techniques is to decrease human interference and still make certain appropriate irrigation. This automated irrigation project brings into play a microcontroller AT89S52 , which is programmed to collect the input signal of changeable moisture circumstances of the earth via moisture detecting sensors.
